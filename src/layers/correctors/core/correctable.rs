//! Error correction configuration trait for database storage protection.

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
/// Configures error correction protection level for a specific type.
///
/// This trait determines if any, and how much error correction protection should be applied when
/// storing and retrieving your type. Different types can have different protection levels based on
/// their importance and corruption tolerance requirements.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// This trait is typically implemented automatically via derive macros, but can also be implemented
/// manually for custom protection strategies.
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// Higher protection levels increase storage overhead and processing time. Choose the minimum level
/// that meets your data integrity requirements.
///
/// # Generics & Lifetimes
///
/// * `V` generic represents the user's value type, for example: `User`, `String`, etc.
/// * `b` lifetime represents bytes potentially being borrowed from the `redb` database.
pub trait Correctable {
    /// Returns the protection conditions for this type.
    ///
    /// # Example Strategies
    ///
    /// This method determines when protection or recovery should be applied to a type. For example:
    /// * `None` 路 Never protect, check, or recover this type.
    /// * `OnRead` 路 Use this when the data being written is always already protected with parity
    ///   shards. Data will be checked and potentially recovered on read.
    /// * `OnWrite` 路 Protect data on write, but return the data still protected by parity-shards
    ///   for furtherance to another node.
    /// * `Both` 路 Transparent & symmetric protection, checking, and recovery for the type.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The [`Direction`] configuration for this type. The same directional setting is used for all
    /// instances of the implementing type.
    ///
    /// # Generics & Lifetimes
    ///
    /// * `V` generic represents the user's value type, for example: `User`, `String`, etc.
    /// * `b` lifetime represents bytes potentially being borrowed from the `redb` database.
    const DIRECTION: crate::layers::core::descriptors::Direction;

    /// Returns the error correction protection level for this type.
    ///
    /// This method determines how much redundancy will be generated alongside the original data
    /// when storing instances of this type. The protection level directly impacts storage overhead
    /// and corruption recovery capabilities.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The [`Level`] configuration for this type. The same protection level is used for
    /// values of this type.

    /// # Generics & Lifetimes
